# Brainstorm Board
A web application designed for anyone who wants to visually organize information. Users can use a canvas to drag and drop (for organization purposes) sticky notes, text boxes, and also draw to visualalize their brainstorm. 

I got this idea as I finished writing the first draft of my new book (that I am hoping to get published soon) and needed an easier way that I could take a broad look at scenes/characters/etc. and make sure that they flow. I then realized that this could be very useful in many other things that I do, such as when I am planning out projects. 

## Features
* **Draw on a canvas** -
* **Add moveable text boxes and sticky notes**
* **Select a template**

## Technologies Used
* **React, HTML, CSS**
* **Node.js**
* **Claude.ai**

**How I used AI**
* To guide me through setting up the development environment, making sure I got everything installed, etc.
* Helping me get the user to actually be able to draw on the canvas and the stroke to not stop too soon before the border and with the eraser tool
* Dragging the text boxes
* Creating a second canvas beneath the first one to hold all of the templates
* The templates (minus the none template)
