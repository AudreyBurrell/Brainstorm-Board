# Brainstorm Board
A web application designed for anyone who wants to visually organize information. Users can use a canvas to drag and drop (for organization purposes) sticky notes, text boxes, and also draw to visualalize their brainstorm. 

I got this idea as I finished writing the first draft of my new book (that I am hoping to get published soon) and needed an easier way that I could take a broad look at scenes/characters/etc. and make sure that they flow. I then realized that this could be very useful in many other things that I do, such as when I am planning out projects.
